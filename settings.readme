Settings
Most hardware-related settings need to be associated with the specific hardware key and subKey. Example:

[aomSynth]                  <--- key
virtual\lowTrip=158e6       <--- subKey\settingsKey

This is so that you can switch between implementations without interference

Note that for the generic GPIB, RS232, and TCP instruments, connection-specific information (ip, GPIB address, baud rate, etc)
are all stored directly under the key for a hardwareobject, not under the subkey! One could change this, theoretically, but 
you'd have to be careful to do it everywhere.

reservedDigitalChannels (int) -- Channels for detecting lock state and asserting lock override; others you want to dedicate. These must all be the lowest pins by number; all above this will be available for general use.

----
units (QString) -- Usually "V" note, if this changes, you need to think through things in the implementation
decimals (int) -- number of decimals to display on controls and indicators
slewStep (units) -- usually V
slewInterval (ms) -- delay between steps when slewing laser
minPos (units)
maxPos (units)

databits -- (int) default QSerialPort::Data8 see QSerialPort::DataBits (the rest of these are all QSerialPort enums as well; none are available on UI)
parity -- (int) default QSerialPort::NoParity

scanNum (int) number of next scan to be run. Note that UI shows last scan that was run, so scanNum will be one greater than what you see on UI
savePath (QString) -- set in main() function; should not be changed
knownValidationKeys -- set automatically, you can add/remove keys manually if you want. If you remove one, it will come back if it's used again
